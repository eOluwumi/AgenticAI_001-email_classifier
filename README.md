#AgenticAI 001 - Email Classification & Response

##Overview

AgenticAI 001 is a multi-agent system designed to classify emails and generate appropriate responses. It leverages the CrewAI framework to coordinate agents that perform distinct tasksâ€”classification and response generation. This is just the beginning of the AgenticAI revolution.

###Features

Automated Email Classification: Categorizes emails as important, casual, or spam.

Contextual Email Responses: Generates concise and appropriate responses based on classification.

Modular Agent-Based Architecture: Utilizes CrewAI agents for task delegation and execution.

Sequential Processing: Ensures classification occurs before response generation.

###Technologies Used

Python

CrewAI

Groq LLaMA3 8B

OpenAI API (via Groq)

Environment Variables for Configurations

###Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/agenticai_001.git
cd agenticai_001

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use .venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set environment variables:

Create a .env file and add:

LITELLM_PROVIDER=groq
OPEN_API_BASE=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=groq/llama3-8b-8192
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Run the script:

python main.py

Usage

The script processes an email and classifies it.

Based on classification, it generates an appropriate response.

Example output:

# Agent: Email Classifier
## Final Answer: spam

# Agent: Email Responder
## Final Answer:
Dear Nigerian Prince,
Thank you for your email. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in your offer of gold. Please don't contact me again.

Next Steps

Enhance classification accuracy with fine-tuned models.

Integrate document-based Q&A for customer support.

Deploy as an API using FastAPI.

Implement logging & monitoring for better insights.
